## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Web bundler
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - BaaS

### What I learned

This project proved to be deceptively challenging. I learned quite a bit about utilizing pseudo elements for sections to place additional content and flair. 

### Continued development

For future projects I'll be exploring more audacious and atypical designs to further refine my CSS skills. Additionally, my use of breakpoints for layout changes is improving, but still needs to be refined.
